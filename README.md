### What I learned

üîé I find a way to reduce font size for smaller screens without using media queries.
I used 'Fluid Typography' with the clamp() function that ensures that the font size stays within a specified range. This technique allows the font size to be flexible and adaptive across different screen sizes while still staying within defined limits.

üëç I also uses a responsive layout for the card-section. In this case, the width of an element is dynamically adjusted based on the viewport width while staying within a specified range: This technique combines fixed and flexible dimensions.
